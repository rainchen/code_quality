## Principle

> If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.


## Installation

```ruby
gem install code_quality
```

Or add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'code_quality'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

To generate security audit and code quality report:

```
code_quality
```

or run as a rake task: `rake code_quality`, [Read More](README_for_rake.md)


will output report like:

```
# Code Quality Report

Generated by code_quality (v0.1.3) @ 2018-01-12 16:32:20 +0800

## bundler audit - checks for vulnerable versions of gems in Gemfile.lock

......

```

[Code Quality Report Details Example](https://rainchen.github.io/code_quality/)

### Two major audit tasks

There are 2 types of audit tasks: `security_audit` and `quality_audit`, each sub task can be run separately.

In summary: 

- run `code_quality security_audit` to get security audit report
- run `code_quality quality_audit` to get code quality report

[Tips] Run `code_quality -T` to display all tasks.

### Report result using Markdown format

You can output report using `code_quality > code_quality_report.md` then open it with a Markdown editor.



### Security Audit

Use [bundler-audit](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler-audit) for patch-level verification for ruby projects which using `bundler`,
 use [brakeman](https://rubygems.org/gems/brakeman) to detect security vulnerabilities for Rails applications.

#### usage:

```
# run security audit tasks
code_quality security_audit
```

output example:

![](doc/imgs/code_quality_security_audit_failed_example.png)

#### options for security_audit:

```
# e.g.: code_quality security_audit bundler_audit_options="--ignore CVE-2015-9284"
# options:
#   bundler_audit_options: pass extract options, e.g.: bundler_audit_options="--ignore CVE-2015-9284 --verbose"
```

#### work with CI

Recommend setting up this task as part of a CI pipeline. For example, adding a job to stage "test" for Gitlab-CI:

```
# .gitlab-ci.yml
code_security_audit:
  stage: test
  script:
    - gem install code_quality
    - code_quality security_audit
```
Gitlab-CI pipeline example:

![](doc/imgs/code_security_audit_faild_on_ci_example.png)

Then Gitlab sends notification with the failure info, for example:

![](doc/imgs/code_security_audit_faild_gitlab_notification_example.png)

[Tips] Code analyzers are your friends for writing secure code, since they're diligent and they don't get tired, thirsty, hungry, or bored.


#### Each sub task can be run separately

```
# bundler audit - checks for vulnerable versions of gems in Gemfile.lock
code_quality security_audit:bundler_audit
```

```
# brakeman audit - checks Ruby on Rails applications for security vulnerabilities
code_quality security_audit:brakeman
```

```
# show helpful URLs
code_quality security_audit:resources
```


### Code Quality Audit

Base on these ruby code analysis gems, you can choose suitable ones for your project:

- use [rubycritic](https://github.com/whitesmith/rubycritic) static analysis gems such as Reek, Flay and Flog to provide a quality report and get an evaluated score of your Ruby code.

- use [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/) to audit coding style and get refactor suggestion.

- use [metric_fu](https://github.com/metricfu/metric_fu) to get many kinds of code metrics from Flog, Flay, Saikuro, Churn, Reek, Roodi, Code Statistics, and Rails Best Practices. (and optionally RCov)


In summary: 

- run `code_quality rubycritic` to get an evaluated score and code smells
- run `code_quality rubocop` to audit coding style and get refactor suggestions
- run `code_quality metric_fu` to get many kinds of code metrics, including rails best practice suggestions, recommend to use for rails project


#### usage:

```
# run all code quality audit tasks
code_quality quality_audit
```

output example:

![](doc/imgs/code_quality_quality_audit_example.png)

[Tips] You don't have to run all audit tasks, some code metrics are the same using by rubycritic and metric_fu. You can choose them based on your needs, the more tasks will take longer running time, unless you don't care about time-consuming problem.


#### Run audit task with audit value option

Audit task will return non-zero exit status and showing failure reason when passing an audit value option and the value is lower than the result in report, for example:

```
# audit with lowest_score option
code_quality quality_audit:rubycritic lowest_score=94.5
```

output example:

![](doc/imgs/code_quality_quality_audit_failed_example.png)

#### Each audit task accepts different audit value options

##### options for rubocop

```
# e.g.: code_quality quality_audit:rubocop rubocop_max_offenses=100
# options:
#   config_formula: use which formula for config, supports "github, "rails" or path_to_your_local_config.yml, default is "github"
#   cli_options: pass extract options, e.g.: cli_options="--show-cops"
#   rubocop_max_offenses: if config rubocop_max_offenses then audit it with detected offenses number in report, e.g.: rubocop_max_offenses=100
```

output example:

![](doc/imgs/code_quality_quality_audit_rubocop_failed_example.png)

##### options for metric_fu

```
# e.g.: code_quality quality_audit:metric_fu metrics=stats,rails_best_practices,roodi rails_best_practices_max_offenses=9 roodi_max_offenses=10
# options:
#   metrics: default to run all metrics, can be config as: cane,churn,flay,flog,hotspots,rails_best_practices,rcov,reek,roodi,saikuro,stats
#   flay_max_offenses: offenses number for audit
#   cane_max_offenses: offenses number for audit
#   rails_best_practices_max_offenses: offenses number for audit
#   reek_max_offenses: offenses number for audit
#   roodi_max_offenses: offenses number for audit
```

output example:

![](doc/imgs/code_quality_quality_audit_metric_fu_failed_example.png)


##### options can be joint together

```
# run all at once
code_quality quality_audit lowest_score=90 rubocop_max_offenses=100 metrics=stats,rails_best_practices,roodi rails_best_practices_max_offenses=10 roodi_max_offenses=10
```

#### work with CI

Configure audit value options that matching to your own ruby/rails project, for example:

```
# .gitlab-ci.yml
code_quality_audit:
  stage: test
  script:
    - gem install code_quality
    - code_quality quality_audit lowest_score=93 rails_best_practices_max_offenses=10

```

[Tips] Don't rely on your diligence, just let CI doing the boring/repeating/time-consuming jobs can make you more enjoyable in programming.


#### code quality audit task report

Code quality audit task report will be saved to `tmp/code_quality/quality_audit/`, and will be auto open in web browser.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
